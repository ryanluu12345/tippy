Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Ryan Nathan Luu

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

During the process of building the application, I ran into three main difficulties related to Xcode, designing a user interface, and using autolayout. First off, I was unfamiliar with Xcode and could not find the object library mentioned in the instructions. After watching the video, I realized that pressing CMD + Shift + L gives the shortcut for the object library. Because I am not particularly skilled at UI development, I found it difficult to design a clean and nice looking interface. Last, I ran into issues with autolayout constraints because I could not initially find the constraint error messages. After some digging, I realized how to address over and under constrained elements.
